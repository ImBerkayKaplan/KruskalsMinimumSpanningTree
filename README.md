# KruskalsMinimumSpanningTree

[Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm) is used to find the edges with the least weight that connects any two trees in the forest. The main file is KruskalsMSF.java. The data folder contains numerous examples to demonstrate the algorithm. You may use those examples to run the program, and take reference when constructing your own examples. The examples are in the format of ```x-y.txt``` where x is the number of vertices in the tree, and y is the number of edges. The first row of these examples indicate the total number of vertices in the tree. The rest of the rows show all edges, as <starting-node>,<ending-node>:<edge-weight>. These example files can be found in the data folder.

## Compilation

Use the make file by simply typing ```make``` in the command line window while in the project directory. This directory will contain the “src” folder. ```make``` command will generate the bin file that has the class files. 

## Execution

To run the program, go to the bin file that is generated by the ```make``` command and type ```java main.KruskalsMSF <x-y.txt>``` when the input file is in the bin. The KruskalsMSF file is in the main folder, and the project runs inside the bin folder that contains all the executables and the input file. You may move some examples from the data folder to the bin folder if you would like to see a demonstration.
